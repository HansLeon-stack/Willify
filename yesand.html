              "Yes And" by Ariana Grande is an empowering anthem that celebrates
              the art of positivity and embracing life's possibilities. The
              song's title, inspired by the improv comedy principle of accepting
              and building on what is given, reflects a mindset of openness and
              growth. In "Yes And," Ariana Grande's signature powerful vocals
              shine as she sings about overcoming challenges and seizing
              opportunities. The lyrics emphasize resilience, adaptability, and
              the importance of saying "yes" to new experiences while also
              adding one's unique touch to them.
