              "Stick Season" by Noah Kahan is a song that captures the essence
              of seasonal change and personal reflection. The title refers to a
              transitional period in New England between fall and winter when
              the trees are bare, symbolizing a time of emptiness and
              anticipation. The lyrics delve into themes of loss, longing, and
              the passage of time, painting a vivid picture of rural life and
              the emotional landscape that comes with it.

            As you promised me that I was more than all the miles combined<br />
            You must have had yourself a change of heart like<br />
            Halfway through the drive<br />
            'Cause your voice trailed off exactly as you passed my exit sign<br />
            Kept on drivin' straight and left our future to the right<br />
            Now I am stuck between my anger and the blame that I can't face<br />
            And memories are somethin' even smoking weed does not replace<br />
            And I am terrified of weather 'cause I see you when it rains<br />
            Doc told me to travel, but there's Covid on the planes<br />
            And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks<br />
            And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed<br />
            And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim<br />
            I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas<br />
            And I'll dream each night of some version of you<br />
            That I might not have, but I did not lose<br />
            Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes<br />
            And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do<br />
            So I thought that if I piled something good on all my bad<br />
            That I could cancel out the darkness I inherited from dad<br />
            No, I am no longer funny, 'cause I miss the way you laugh<br />
            You once called me forever, now you still can't call me back<br />
            And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks<br />
            And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed<br />
            And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim<br />
            I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas<br />
            And I'll dream each night of some version of you<br />
            That I might not have, but I did not lose<br />
            Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes<br />
            And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do<br />
            Oh, that'll have to do<br />
            My other half was you<br />
            I hope this pain's just passin' through<br />
            But I doubt it<br />
            And I love Vermont, but it's the season of the sticks<br />
            And I saw your mom, she forgot that I existed<br />
            And it's half my fault, but I just like to play the victim<br />
            I'll drink alcohol 'til my friends come home for Christmas<br />
            And I'll dream each night of some version of you<br />
            That I might not have, but I did not lose<br />
            Now you're tire tracks and one pair of shoes<br />
            And I'm split in half, but that'll have to do<br />
            Have to do<br />
