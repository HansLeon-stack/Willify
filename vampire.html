              "Vampire" by Olivia Rodrigo is a powerful pop-rock anthem that
              delves into themes of betrayal and emotional turmoil. The song
              combines haunting melodies with raw, emotional lyrics, reflecting
              Rodrigo's distinct style. In "Vampire," she addresses a toxic
              relationship where the other person is likened to a vampire,
              metaphorically sucking the life out of her. The track showcases
              Rodrigo's vocal prowess and songwriting skills, making it a
              standout hit in 2024.

            Hate to give the satisfaction, asking how you're doing now<br />How's
            the castle built off people you pretend to care about?<br />Just
            what you wanted<br />Look at you, cool guy, you got it<br />
            I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes<br />Six
            months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise<br />I loved
            you truly<br />Gotta laugh at the stupidity<br />
            'Cause I've made some real big mistakes<br />But you make the worst
            one look fine<br />I should've known it was strange<br />You only
            come out at night<br />I used to think I was smart<br />But you made
            me look so naive<br />The way you sold me for parts<br />As you sunk
            your teeth into me, oh<br />Bloodsucker, famefucker<br />Bleedin' me
            dry, like a goddamn vampire<br />
            And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news<br />You
            called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called them crazy too<br />You're
            so convincing<br />How do you lie without flinching? (How do you
            lie, how do you lie, how do you lie?)<br />
            Ooh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked-up little thrill<br />Can't
            figure out just how you do it, and God knows I never will<br />Went
            for me, and not her<br />'Cause girls your age know better<br />
            I've made some real big mistakes<br />But you make the worst one
            look fine<br />I should've known it was strange<br />You only come
            out at night<br />I used to think I was smart<br />But you've made
            me look so naive<br />The way you sold me for parts<br />As you sunk
            your teeth into me, oh<br />Bloodsucker, famefucker<br />Bleedin' me
            dry, like a goddamn vampire<br />
            You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?<br />You can't
            love anyone, 'cause that would mean you had a heart<br />I tried you
            help you out, now I know that I can't<br />'Cause how you think's
            the kind of thing I'll never understand<br />
            I've made some real big mistakes<br />But you make the worst one
            look fine<br />I should've known it was strange<br />You only come
