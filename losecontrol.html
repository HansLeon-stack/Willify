              "Lose Control" by Teddy Swims is a soulful track that delves into
              the intense emotions of love and desire. The song captures the
              feeling of being overwhelmed by attraction and the powerful pull
              of a deep connection with someone special. Teddy Swims' rich,
              emotive vocals convey the raw intensity and vulnerability of
              giving in to these feelings. The lyrics speak to the experience of
              losing control in the best way possible, surrendering to the
              passion and excitement that comes with being in love.

            Something's got a hold of me lately<br />
            No, I don't know myself anymore<br />
            Feels like the walls are all closin' in<br />
            And the devil's knockin' at my door, whoa<br />
            Out of my mind, how many times<br />
            Did I tell you I'm no good at bein' alone?<br />
            Yeah, it's takin' a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep<br />
            From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know<br />
            I lose control<br />
            When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)<br />
            I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br />
            I lose control<br />
            When you're not next to me, mm-hm<br />
            Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br />
            You make a mess of me<br />
            Problematic<br />
            Problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit<br />
            Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you<br />
            Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own<br />
            But I want that real full moon black magic and it takes two<br />
            Problematic<br />
            Problem is when I'm with you, I'm an addict<br />
            And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth<br />
            Can't see the forest through the trees<br />
            Got me down on my knees, darlin' please, oh<br />
            I lose control<br />
            When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)<br />
            I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br />
            I lose control<br />
            When you're not next to me, mm-hm<br />
            Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br />
            You make a mess of me, yeah<br />
            I lose control<br />
            When you're not here with me, mm<br />
            I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br />
            I lose control<br />
            When you're not here with me, mm-hm<br />
            Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br />
